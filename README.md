This project takes user inputs to find a file, mode to open it in, and a category of data to filter it on, upper and lower limits of the data, and prints out tables based on all of these.
To use this program you have to first enter a valid file name, then specify the mode you would like to open the file in, then enter the category of data you would like to filter, then enter the upper and lower limits for the data you would like filtered. You can also quit the program at anytime if you change your mind.
